Add a voice assistant to your application. With no or minimal changes to the existing UI.

## How to start

To bring voice control to an Ionic application:

1. [Sign up for Alan Studio](https://studio.alan.app/register) to build and test voice scripts in JavaScript.
2. Use the Alan Ionic SDK to embed the Alan button to your application. For details, see [Alan AI documentation](https://alan.app/docs/client-api/cross-platform/ionic).

## Example  apps

In the [Examples](https://github.com/alan-ai/alan-sdk-ionic/tree/master/examples) folder, you can find example apps integrated with the Alan voice SDK for Ionic. Launch the app, tap the Alan button and start giving voice commands. For example, you can ask: "Hello" or "What does this app do?"
